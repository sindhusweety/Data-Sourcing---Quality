    "### THIS IS FOR EXPOSITION PURPOSES ONLY!\n",
    "The moral here - choose your weapon wisely.  RegExs (exclusively) are not a good tool choice\n",
    "to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function receives a (word/string) as a parameter. The objective\n",
    " of the function is to convert the incoming string to its \"Pig Latin\"\n",
    " equivalent and return the Pig Latin string.  Yes, this is the same\n",
    " exercise used in the Python strings lab; however, this time you are\n",
    " required to use RE methods to complete the text manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will use the following as the rules for\n",
    " translation of a word into \"Pig Latin\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A word is a consecutive sequence of letters (a-z, A-Z) or\n",
    " apostrophes. You may assume that the input to the function will only\n",
    " be a single \"word\". Examples: Zebra , doesn't , apple\n",
    "2. If a word starts with a vowel, the Pig Latin version is the\n",
    " original word with \"way\" added to the end\n",
    "3. If a word starts with a consonant, or a series of consecutive\n",
    " consonants, the Pig Latin version transfers ALL consonants up to the\n",
    " first vowel to the end of the word, and adds \"ay\" to the end.\n",
    "4. The letter 'y' should be treated as a consonant if it is the\n",
    " first letter of a word, but treated as a vowel otherwise.\n",
    "5. If the original word is capitalized, the new Pig Latin version of\n",
    " the word should be capitalized in the first letter.  If the original\n",
    " capital letter was a consonant, and thus moved, it should not be\n",
    " capitalized once in its new location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Requirements\n",
    "1. Author your 'ToPigLatin' function\n",
    "2. Convert the following test data into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Word (keys) | Pig Latin (values)\n",
    "-----------------|-------------------\n",
    "football | ootballfay\n",

    "ontology | ontologyway\n",
    "yellow | ellowyay\n",
    "yttrium | iumyttray\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Iterate over the test data and invoke your *ToPigLatin* function.\n",
    "4. Confirm your returned results against the values in the second column\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverable\n",
    "For each test word, print the test word and its Pig Latin translation.\n",
    "Print each pair on a separate line."
