    "# API-Based Data Wrangling in Python â€“ Simple Cases\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "You may recall that the ugly truth about collecting data from an API is that every\n",
    " API source can be and usually is unique.  By that I mean, while the data\n",
    " returned will almost always be in a standard file format (CSV, JSON,\n",
    " XML), the API endpoint navigation and interactions and returned data\n",
    " schema (and thus interpretation) will most certainly be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    " Long story short, <u>your success will depend on your ability to read,\n",
    " interpret, and implement technical information pertaining to a\n",
    " service's APIs and their returned data.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to ensure we make a successful request, when we work with\n",
    " APIs it's important to consult the documentation. Technical\n",
    " documentation can seem daunting at first, but as you use documentation\n",
    " more and more you'll find it gets easier.  And, of course, some docs\n",
    " are better than others."

    "## Question\n",
    "The Star Wars API (SWAPI) is maintained by avid Star Wars fans.  SWAPI\n",
    " is the world's first quantified and programmatically-formatted\n",
    " Star Wars dataset.  Apparently, the data returned by the API has been\n",
    " complied after countless hours of watching films and trawling through\n",
    " content online.  The API exposes endpoints capable of providing data\n",
    " about People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from\n",
    " the Star Wars movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API documentation should help you familiarize yourself with the\n",
    " resources available and how to consume them with HTTP requests.  Read\n",
    " through the getting started section before you dive in. Most issues\n",
    " can be resolved by reading the documentation.  Star Wars API\n",
    " Documentation (https://swapi.dev/documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how several of the APIs are logically 'linked' - ie., related.  This concept is\n",
    "best seen by looking at the attributes returned for the films endpoint\n",
    " (https://swapi.dev/api/films/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The films API returns JSON data.  Within that data is an array titled characters.  The\n",
    " characters attribute is an array of other SWAPI endpoints that that can be used to\n",
    " return the people endpoint data for all of the characters in the film.\n",
    "This type of relationship linking is common in Web APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. use the SWAPI films endpoint to return the data for all Star Wars films.\n",
    "2. isolate/find the film data for the film title *A New Hope*\n",
    "3. use the starships array from A New Hope to make HTTP requests for the data for all\n",
    " of the starships featured in this one film.\n",
    "4. using the starships array attribute 'films', for each starship associated with *A New Hope*,\n",
    "what is the name of the starship that has appeared (by count) in the greatest number of films.\n",
    "You may ignore any ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Logic\n",
    "* use the films endpoint to return all films.\n",
    "* for each returned film, find the film with title *A New Hope*\n",
    "* For that film, save variable reference to the starships array\n",
    "* For each starship endpoint for the film, request the starship endpoint\n",
    "* For each returned starship save the count of items in the films list\n",
    "* Find the max count of films\n",
    "* Display the starship name and max count of films\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** It is impossible to complete this task without reviewing (and understanding) the technical documents that describe the API.\n"
