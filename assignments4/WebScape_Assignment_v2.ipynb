    "## Question 1 - Book Data Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to collect some price data about books from the Books to Scrape website.\n",
    "Specifically, you are to scrape and capture the following book related information - book category,\n",
    "book title, star rating and price. Once captured, display your results one book per output line.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Top-Level URL: http://books.toscrape.com/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. Examine the HTML returned from the Books to Scrape top-level URL.\n",
    " Your objective is to identify and extract book category and the book\n",
    " category URL information from this page.\n",
    "2. For each book category URL, follow the URL to the book category\n",
    " page. You may restrict your data scraping to the first page of books\n",
    " returned for the category URL.\n",
    "3. For each of the books on a category page, capture the book title,\n",
    " star rating and price.\n",
    "4. Convert the ordinal star rating data to a numeric scale. For\n",
    " example, the string 'star-rating One' would be converted to the integer number\n",
    " 1, 'star-rating Two' would be converted to 2, and so on.\n",
    "5. For each book, output the book category, title, numeric star rating and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge (Optional)\n",
    "The challenge objective is to display all books (formatted as above) from all categories - not \n",
    " just the first page of books from each category.  To see how this works, go the \n",
    " top-level URL and observe how to \n",
    " manually navigate from the first page of a category to the next, then next, etc. until you have \n",
    " followed the Next link to all pages for a category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that book data from a category URL is returned 20 books at a time. If there more than \n",
    "20 books in category, the Next link appears at the bottom of the HTML page.  \n",
    "When the list of books in a category has been exhausted, ie., when the last\n",
    "category page has been reached, the Next link will no longer appear on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: That's how you will know your job is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy your previous solution to a new code-cell. Modify your copied solution to follow\n",
    "the Next page links located at the bottom of a category page. "
